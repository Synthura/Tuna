# Tuna

## Setup
Run
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Or even better, [create a virtual environment](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments) in vscode and select install from requirements.txt

Install https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/ to view the database. 

## Notes
We are using sqlite for testing purposes, but we will migrate to a proper RDBMS like PostgreSQL once we've set up a cloud server I presume.
